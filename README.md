# Hawk- Multispecialty Variable Payload Drone Object Detection with YOLOv3
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an object detection model based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The model is trained to detect various objects from images captured by a multispecialty variable payload drone. The drone is equipped with different types of sensors and cameras, enabling it to perform tasks across multiple domains, including surveillance, search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and more.

## A minimal PyTorch implementation of YOLOv3, with support for training, inference, and evaluation.
YOLOv4 and YOLOv7 weights are also compatible with this implementation.

## Key concepts

YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once):

YOLOv3 is a real-time object detection algorithm that divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. It is known for its speed and accuracy in detecting objects in images.

### Multispecialty Variable Payload Drone:

This refers to a drone equipped with various sensors and cameras capable of performing tasks across multiple domains or specialties, such as surveillance, search and rescue, environmental monitoring, etc. The "variable payload" aspect implies the drone's ability to carry different types of payloads or equipment based on the task requirements.

### Object Detection:

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects of interest within an image or video frame. In this project, YOLOv3 is used for object detection to detect various objects present in images captured by the drone.

### Dataset:

A dataset is a collection of labeled images used for training and evaluating machine learning models. In this project, the dataset comprises images captured by the drone along with annotations specifying the location and class of objects within the images.

### Training:

Training refers to the process of teaching a machine learning model, such as YOLOv3, to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data. During training, the model learns to associate input images with corresponding ground truth annotations to improve its performance.

### Inference:

Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data. In this project, inference involves running the trained YOLOv3 model on images captured by the drone to detect objects in real-time or batch-processing mode.

### Pre-trained Model:

A pre-trained model is a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset for a specific task, such as object detection. In this project, pre-trained YOLOv3 model weights are provided or can be trained from scratch using the dataset.

### Performance Metrics:

Performance metrics are quantitative measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of a machine learning model. Common metrics for object detection tasks include precision, recall, F1-score, mean average precision (mAP), etc. These metrics help assess the accuracy and efficiency of the YOLOv3 model in detecting objects.
These terms provide a foundational understanding of the key concepts and components involved in the multispecialty drone object detection project using YOLOv3.

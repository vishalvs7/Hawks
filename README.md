Agricultural surveillance system using Machine learning 

**Convolutional neural network (CNN) ** was utilised. The CNN is another type of neural network that can uncover key information in both time series and image data.  A deep learning CNN consists of three layers: a convolutional layer, a pooling layer and a fully connected (FC) layer. The convolutional layer is the first layer while the FC layer is the last. 

a frame by frame surveillance system was to used which could give us the the live video capturing as well as video processing. 
For this purpose We used Python Libraries such as OpenCV and Scikit Image.
